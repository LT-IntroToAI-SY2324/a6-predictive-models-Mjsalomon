# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

Since training data and testing data are being use it is more effective because training data allows the machine to learn potential patters that allows for testing data to test and predict values for unseen data which allows it to be more effective.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The higher the R squared coefficient is, the stronger the correlation between the two things that are being tested.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Association’s website on understanding blood pressure.

The meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Association’s website on understanding blood pressure. I believe that the model is not very accurate. Based on some R squared values like 0.554, 0.476, and 0.669, it isn't the highest number that it could possibly be. Some of the data points tend to be very high or very low compared to the predictions the model makes. An accurate model would be .75 and above I believe.
